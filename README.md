This project simulates PWM-based motor control using an ESC (Electronic Speed Controller) on an STM32 microcontroller.

Configured a timer to generate a 50 Hz PWM signal (20 ms period).

Dynamically varied the duty cycle between 1 ms and 2 ms to simulate throttle range for ESC.

Verified PWM behavior by routing the signal to an LED — brightness changes with duty cycle, mimicking motor speed control.
